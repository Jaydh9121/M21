### SMS Spam Detection Web App

**Description:**
This project is a simple web application for detecting whether a given text message is spam or not. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on SMS text data to classify messages as either "spam" or "not spam".

**Files:**
- `sms_classification.py`: Python script containing the code for training the machine learning model and defining the prediction function.
- `sms_app.py`: Python script defining the Gradio interface for the web app.
- `SMSSpamCollection.csv`: Dataset containing SMS text messages labeled as spam or not spam.

**Dependencies:**
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning tasks.
- `gradio`: For creating the web app interface.

**Instructions:**
1. Install the required dependencies using `pip install pandas scikit-learn gradio`.
2. Run the `sms_classification.py` script to train the model and define the prediction function.
3. Run the `sms_app.py` script to launch the web app.
4. Access the web app in your browser and enter a text message to determine if it's spam or not.

### SMS Spam Detection Model Training and Evaluation

**Description:**
This project involves training a machine learning model to classify SMS text messages as either "spam" or "not spam". It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

**Files:**
- `sms_model_training.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training the machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.
- `SMSSpamCollection.csv`: Dataset containing SMS text messages labeled as spam or not spam.

**Dependencies:**
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning tasks.

**Instructions:**
1. Open the `sms_model_training.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
2. Run the code cells sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Follow the comments and instructions provided in the notebook for each step.
4. Optionally, modify the code or experiment with different preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to improve the model's performance.

**Technology Used:**

Python (or any other programming language of choice) Command-line interface (CLI) or Graphical user interface (GUI) based on the application design Contribution Code used in this project was referenced from prior modules, ChatGPT, Copilot, and various Google searches to help understand syntax and correct errors.
